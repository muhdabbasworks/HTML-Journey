# Day 03 – HTML Revision & Practice

## What I did today
- I spent the entire day revising previously learned HTML concepts.
- Practiced writing clean and semantic HTML structure.
- Focused on understanding *why use the tag* a tag is used, not just *how to use tag*.

## Concepts revised
- HTML document structure
- Semantic tags:
  - header
  - main
  - article
  - footer
  - aside
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Nested lists
- Text formatting tags

## Mistakes I fixed
- Nested lists must always be placed inside a '<li>' tag.
- `<ol>` and `<ul>` must contain `<li>` elements.
- Used `<sup>` instead of `<sub>` for  (H₂O).
- Understood the difference between:
  - Visual tags (`<b>`, `<i>`)
  - Semantic tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`)

## Key learning
- Semantic HTML improves readability, accessibility, and structure.
- Not every page needs a `<section>` tag.
- `<article>` can be used directly inside `<main>` when content is independent.

## Reflection
Today was a revision day to avoid rushing.
This helped me strengthen my understanding and write cleaner HTML.
